# Introduction

Diffusion is a command-line tool to compare different SVN revisions and display
the differences in a GUI-based tool (FileMerge in OS X, Meld in Linux).

# Origins

This tool was inspired by `svnd`, a bash script by Raphael M. Reischuk
(@reischuk) that effectively does the same thing.
